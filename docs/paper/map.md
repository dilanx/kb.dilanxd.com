# Map

Find your classes using Paper's map and minimap!

## Using the full map

Open the full map by clicking on the **Map** button in the toolbar at the top. You can also use the **expand icon** button in the top right of the [minimap](#using-the-minimap).

**Hover over a marker** to view the course sections on your schedule that meet at that location. **Hover over a course section name** in the panel at the right side to quickly center the respective marker.

Finally, use the **MINIMAP** switch in the top right to toggle the minimap on and off.

## Using the minimap

**Hovering over a course section** either in the search box or on your schedule will show a marker on the class section's location on the minimap.

You can also **hover over a location** in the course information card.

### Enabling and disabling the minimap

The minimap is enabled by default. You can enable or disable it by using the **MINIMAP** switch in the top right of the [full map](#using-the-full-map).

:::note Note: Small Window Sizes

In a window with a small height, the minimap will be hidden and toggling the switch will have no effect (a message appears below the switch when your screen height is too small).

## Using external room finders

Some locations will support opening an external room finder. These locations will have a **solid underline** and a **map icon** next to them in their course information card. It'll also tell you on the minimap when you're hovering over a section that has a location with an external room finder.

Clicking on the location will open the external room finder in a new tab. Courses that don't support a room finder will have a **dotted underline** instead.
