# Bookmarks

Not completely sure where a course should go but know you want to take it? Bookmark it for later!

## About bookmarks

Switch to the **Bookmarks** tab to view your bookmarks lists. On plans, you'll see two sections with the labels **Bookmarked courses** and **For credit**. On schedules, you'll only see the **Bookmarked courses** section.

Bookmarks will be included with your plan or schedule when [sharing](./share.md) a link.

## Bookmarking a course

There are a bunch of different ways to add and remove bookmarked courses:

- **Drag and drop** a course into a list (plans only).
- **Press the bookmark icon button** in the top right of a course in the search box (bookmarked courses section only).
- **Click on the course in the search box** and select one of the bookmark list buttons (plans only).
- **Click on the button in the course information card** (bookmarked courses section only).

Remove a bookmark by pressing any of the **bookmark** buttons again or by hovering over a course in the bookmark courses sections and pressing the **trash icon** button (plans) or the **minus icon** button (schedules). Not sure why I made the icons different. Maybe I'll change that one day.
