# Plans: Bookmarking Courses

Not completely sure where a course should go but know you want to take it? Bookmark it for later!

![Course bookmarks](/img/paper/plans-bookmarks-1.png)

## About bookmarks

Switch to the **Bookmarks** tab to see two sections with the labels **Bookmarked courses** and **For credit**.

**Bookmarked courses** are courses you've bookmarked for later (lol who would've thought).

**For credit** courses count towards your **total unit count** that can be viewed at the bottom of the plan. Use this to include AP/IB credits, transfer credits, or anything else that would count towards graduation but aren't taken during a specific quarter.

## Bookmarking a course

There are a few ways to bookmark a course:

- **Drag and drop** a course into either section.
- Click on the **bookmark icon** button that appears as you hover over a course in the search box (bookmarked courses section only).
- Click on the **course** (either in search or on the plan) and select one of the **bookmark** buttons.

Remove a bookmark by pressing any of the **bookmark** buttons again or by hovering over a course in the bookmark courses sections and pressing the **trash icon** button.
