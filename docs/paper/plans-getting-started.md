# Plans: Getting Started

Paper has a powerful 4-year (technically up to 10-year) plan builder to help you plan your journey through Northwestern. Get started using the **Plan** button at the top of the left sidebar.

## Creating a plan

You can certainly start searching and adding courses right away, but I recommend creating an account to save your plan to. You can save up to 5 plans to your account, which you can easily switch between and access from any device. You also unlock some extra features like [Notes](./notes.md) and can be confident that you won't lose your plan when clearing website data or using a different device. Start by pressing the **Sign in** button at the top right and following the prompts. Then, when you're sent back to Paper, switch to the **Plans** tab at the bottom.

Press **Create plan**, give it a name, and press **Create**. You'll see your plan appear in the list with the **EMPTY** indicator on it. Click on it to make it **ACTIVE**.

## Editing your plan's contents

Once your plan is **ACTIVE** (it should say your plan's name in the toolbar at the top!), you can start adding courses to it. Switch to the **Search** tab, search for a course, and **drag** it into a quarter.

You can **drag** courses from the search box to your plan or between quarters.

:::note

If you'd prefer not to drag, you can click on the course in search, which will reveal a button for each quarter in each year. Clicking on a button will add the course to that quarter.

:::

To delete a course, hover over that course in your plan and press the **trash icon** button.

Then, hit save!

:::warning Don't forget to save!

You should get warnings if trying to navigate away from an unsaved plan, but make sure to save whenever you make any changes!

## Viewing course information

Clicking on any course in your plan will reveal some **course information**, right within Paper!

## Adding a summer quarter

All years have a **plus icon** button at the top right, which you can use to add a summer quarter to that year.

You can use the same button (which becomes a **minus icon** button) to remove it.

## Adding a year

While a minimum of **4 years** will always be shown, you can add up to a total of **10 years**! Scroll to the bottom of your plan and press **Add year**.

## Next steps

That's all you really need to know to get started with plans! However, improve your planning experience with some more of the fancy Paper functionality:

- [**Searching**, the cool way](./plans-search.md)
- [Saving classes for later with **Bookmarks**](./plans-bookmarks.md)
- [Adding custom text to your plans with **Notes**](./notes.md)
- [**Sharing** your plans with friends or advisors](./plans-share.md)
