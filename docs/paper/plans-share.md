# Plans: Sharing

You can share your plans with anyone (friends and advisors, for example) very easily!

![Sharing a plan](/img/paper/plans-share-1.png)

## Share a plan

Press **Export** in the toolbar at the top of the page, then select **Share link**. A shareable link will be generated, which you can then save or send to whoever.

## Important things to note

- The link is not tied to your actual plan. It is a **copy**.
  - Any changes you make to your plan will **not** be reflected in that same link. You'll need to share again.
  - Any changes others make to your plan when accessing it through the shared link are **not** reflected in your plan.
- The [plan name](./plans-getting-started.md#creating-a-plan) and [notes](./notes.md) are **not** shared with the link.
