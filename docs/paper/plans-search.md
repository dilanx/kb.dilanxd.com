Paper has powerful search functionality to help you find the exact courses you're looking for.

## Searching by name

Search for courses by **course subject and number**, or by **course title**.

:::tip Tip: Search Shortcuts

Paper supports common subject shortcuts! For example, **CS** turns into **COMP_SCI**, **ME** turns into **MECH_ENG**, and a bunch more. You can even use **DTC** to get both **DSGN 106** and **ENGLISH 106**.

- **SUBJECT**: Courses will be filtered by the specified subject.
- **DISTRIBUTION AREAS**: Courses will be filtered by **any** of the selected distribution areas.
- **UNITS AT LEAST** (min) and **UNITS AT MOST** (max): Courses will be filtered by the number of units they are worth. If either field is left blank, there will be no min or max, respectively.
- **INCLUDE Legacy Courses**: If checked, courses that are no longer offered will be included in the search results. This can be useful if you're adding old courses you've taken to previous years.
