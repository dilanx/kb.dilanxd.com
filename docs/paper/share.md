# Share

You can share your plans and schedules with anyone (friends, family, advisors, etc.) very easily!

![Sharing a plan or schedule](/img/paper/share-1.png)

## Share by link

Press **Export** in the toolbar at the top of the page, then select **Share link**. A shareable link will be generated, which you can then save or send to whomever.

:::info Important things to note

- The link is not tied to your actual plan or schedule. It is a **copy**.
  - Any changes you make to your plan or schedule will **not** be reflected in that same link. You'll need to share again.
  - Any changes others make to your plan or schedule when accessing it through the shared link are **not** reflected in yours.
- The [plan name](./getting-started-with-plans.md#creating-a-plan) or [schedule name](./getting-started-with-schedules.md#creating-a-schedule) and any [notes](./notes.md) you may have are **not** shared with the link. [Bookmarks](./bookmarks.md) are.
